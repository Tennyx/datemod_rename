# datemod_rename
A python script that renames all files in a folder to their modified date in format Y-m-d-H.M.S. Great for organizing photos, videos or other files with various naming conventions.

Navigate to the script or add it to your path, then run `python datemod_rename <filepath_to_folder>`.

For example:

```
DSC_0182.jpg
IMG_1513.jpg
```

becomes:

```
2017-06-17-20.42.56.jpg
2017-06-18-02.43.00.jpg
```

Enjoy!
